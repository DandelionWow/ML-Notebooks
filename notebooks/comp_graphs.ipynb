    "In this notebook we provide a short introduction and overview of computational graphs using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several materials online that cover theory on the topic of computational graphs. However, I think it's much easier to learn the concept using code. I attempt to bridge the gap here which should be useful for beginner students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Olah's article [\"Calculus on Computational Graphs: Backpropagation\"](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/), I've put together a few code snippets to get you started with computationsl graphs with PyTorch. This notebook should complement that article, so refer to it for more comprehensive explanations. In fact, I've tried to simplify the explanations and refer to them here."

    "### Why Computational Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about neural networks in any context, [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) is an important topic to understand because it is the algorithm used for training deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is used to calculate derivatives which is what you need to keep optimizing parameters of the model and allowing the model to learn on the task at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the deep learning frameworks today like PyTorch does the backpropagation out-of-the-box using [**automatic differentiation**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how this is done it's important to talk about **computational graphs** which defines the flow of computations that are carried out throughout the network. Along the way we will use `torch.autograd` to demonstrate in code how this works. "

    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Olah's article on computational graphs, let's look at the following expression $e = (a + b) * (b+1)$. It helps to break it down to the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}&c=a+b \\\\&d=b+1 \\\\&e=c * d\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a neural network of any sort. We are just going through a very simple example of a chain of operations which you can be represented with computational graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize these operations using a computational graph. Computational graphs contain **nodes** which can represent and input (tensor, matrix, vector, scalar) or **operation** that can be the input to another node. The nodes are connected by **edges**, which represent a function argument, they are pointers to nodes. Note that the computation graphs are directed and acyclic. The computational graph for our example looks as follows:\n",

    "We can evaluate the expression by setting our input variables as follows: $a=2$ and $b=1$. This will allow us to compute nodes up through the graph as shown in the computational graph above.  \n",
